      "It was our final project that we did to graduate from Moringa School. Optica has a curated collection of eyewear available in many styles and colors. They face a challenge in viewing all available frames/sunglasses based on the design selected. This challenge reduces efficiency and wastes time for both our customers and staff. A proposal was made to develop an app that enables both customers and staff to efficiently explore their collection by uploading images and displaying similar designs. This application would function as a visual search or recommendation engine.",
